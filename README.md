# My nVim Setup

## Setup

My nVim setup is written in lua. The init.lua file requires every file in the lua folder which will be used to customize nVim. To make the structure more overviewing, all the Plugins will be seperated in their designated file or folder.

## Plugins

1. CMP (Autocompletion)
1. LSP (Autocompletion Addon for Info-window)
1. NeoTree (File Manager)
1. Telescope (File Finder)
